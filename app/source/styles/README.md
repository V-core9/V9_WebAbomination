# Sass Boilerplate

This is a sample project using the [7-1 architecture pattern](http://sass-guidelin.es/#architecture) and sticking to [Sass Guidelines](http://sass-guidelin.es) writing conventions.

Each folder of this project has its own `README.md` file to explain the purpose and add extra information. Be sure to browse the repository to see how it works.

## Use with Node-sass

When using `node-sass` - in order to build that boilerplate, one needs to:

- install `node-sass` if not yet installed:

```bash
npm install -g node-sass
```

- run build command from command line:

```bash
node-sass source/styles/main.scss public/styles/main.css
```
