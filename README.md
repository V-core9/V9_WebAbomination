## **🌀 Additional Description Info**    

Nothing much to say here just wanna have something that will expand the text and show-off some of the blocks it can do.
    
    For now it's pretty simple without many complications. Resulting in not that complicated nor helpful expanding it yet. Need few other things sorted before we get out to v1.

          npm install v-core9 --save
          
    Soon... 🚀
